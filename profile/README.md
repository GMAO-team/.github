## About this repository

- contribution docs (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`),
- issue / PR templates (`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`),
- shared CI workflows (`workflows/`) if you choose to centralize them via `workflow_call`.

## What we’re building

**GMAO (CMMS)** — *Gestion de Maintenance Assistée par Ordinateur* — a pragmatic, production-minded CMMS for teams that need **assets, work orders, preventive plans, inventory, purchasing, meters, procedures, integrations, a requests portal, and reporting** without the complexity tax.

See the organization profile (rendered from `profile/README.md`) for screenshots, roadmap, and contribution paths.
